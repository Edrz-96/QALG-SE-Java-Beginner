    // OOP - Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Inheritance, Abstraction.

    // Encapsulation - "protection", "public", "private", "default"

    // private int number; To access we'd need a getter/setter. If I only wanted to view the number,
    // I wouldn't create a setter.

    // Polymorphism - This means, when using, or creating a new object, I would
    // expect to be able to access "polymorphic routes" between other objects. Aka, everything is an object.
    // That would mean, the sub-class or parent-class is available in the context the objects instance.

    // Inheritance - The method by which we apply functionality to sub-classes.

    // Remember Java's answer to multiple inheritance is the use of implements keyword.

    // Abstraction - Abstraction is hiding unnecessary information from the developer, we can do this in two ways:
    // via interfaces and via abstract classes. Within interfaces the "implementation" is mandatory and each "empty"
    // method body will need to be "implemented". As for the abstract classes these are a way to get around said
    // mandatory implementation processes.
